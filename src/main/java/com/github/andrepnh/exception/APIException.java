// If we used checked exceptions then we'd have to add "throws" pretty much everywhere since this is
// associated with core validation. Another option would be to throw another exception and map to
// this one, but in the end it's much simpler to just use an unchecked exception. It also makes
// sense, because there's no point in forcing all clients to recover from passing bad arguments.
